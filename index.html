          <h2>Your child's home away from home starts with the person waiting at the door.</h2>
          <blockquote>"I've spent my career making sure people are safe, cared for, and seen. Safe Space is where I bring that same standard home — literally."</blockquote>
          <p>My name's Nana. By day, I manage a non-profit healthcare facility that includes a pediatric office — a career built on keeping people safe, especially the little ones. I've spent years in a world where attention to detail isn't optional. It's everything. I know what a fever looks like before the thermometer confirms it, when a rash is nothing, and when a parent needs a call.</p>
          <p>But before all of that, I was a mother. Four children of my own, twelve grandchildren now, and every one of them taught me something new about how little ones see the world. That's the part no credential can teach you — the patience to read the same book four times in a row because the fourth time is when the magic happens.</p>
          <p>Safe Space is my home. Not a center, not a facility — my home. The same floors my grandchildren have crawled across, the same kitchen where we bake banana bread on rainy mornings, the same backyard where the mud puddles have names. I believe children don't need programs. They need a person who sees them — who notices when they're about to stack that third block, who knows the difference between a tired cry and a frustrated one. That's what I do. That's what I've always done.</p>

        <h2>Children are born knowing how to learn. We just give them the space to do it.</h2>
        <p>Every child who walks through our door is already a scientist, an artist, and an explorer. They don't need us to fill them with knowledge — they need us to notice what they're discovering and build on it. That's what we do, every single day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pillars">
        <div class="pillar fade-in">
          <div class="pillar-icon">🌱</div>
          <h3>Follow the Child</h3>
          <p>Children tell you what they're ready to learn, if you're paying attention. When a toddler lines up every shoe by the door, that's not a mess — that's sorting, sequencing, and spatial reasoning. We see it, we name it, and we build on it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pillar fade-in">
          <div class="pillar-icon">🏡</div>
          <h3>Home First</h3>
          <p>This is a home, not a classroom. Children eat at a real table, play in a real yard, and curl up on a real couch for story time. The environment itself teaches safety, belonging, and the rhythms of daily life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pillar fade-in">
          <div class="pillar-icon">🤲</div>
          <h3>Relationships Over Routines</h3>
          <p>A child who feels safe will try anything. Our small group means every child is known deeply — their comfort objects, their favorite songs, the way they need the lights low at nap time. We adjust to them, not the other way around.</p>

          <p>Safe Space is located in Talking Rock, Georgia — a small community in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Out here, the backyard is big enough to run in, quiet enough to hear a woodpecker, and safe enough that the biggest danger is a muddy pair of shoes.</p>
          <p>Our childcare space is purpose-built within our home, designed to meet every DECAL safety and health requirement while still feeling like exactly what it is — a warm, lived-in home where children are welcome.</p>
          <p>There are no fluorescent lights. No industrial carpet. No plastic smell. Just natural light, real furniture, and a space that was designed by someone who raised children in it.</p>
